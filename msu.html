            <p> I’m not sure if you can call Michigan State a “thing”, but is definitely one of my 
                favorite place to be a part of. Being a student at MSU has been an awesome experience. 
                My years here have been full of making new friends, supporting our impressive sports 
                teams, exploring our beautiful campus and the rest of East Lansing, and of course, 
                learning. The picture shown here really exemplifies what it feels like to be a Spartan: 
                50,000 fans supporting their team to victory under the lights. What a place to be.</p>
