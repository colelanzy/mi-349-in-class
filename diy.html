    <h1>DIY Projects / Woodworking</h1>
    <p> Over the last year or so, I have loved working on small projects. 
        Pictured on the right is a corn hole board that I built this summer '24. 
        Could I have went to the store and just bought a new set of corn hole 
        boards? Of course, but what's the fun in that ? Instead I spent hours 
        throughout several days working on them, buying materials, cutting wood, 
        sanding, putting it all together and finally staining them. There is 
        something about making something yourself that makes it much more valuable 
        to you. I am looking forwards to whatever my next project will be.</p>
